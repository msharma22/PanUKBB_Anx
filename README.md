# Welcome! 

Here, you will find the scripts and files used for the research article, _Brain Transcriptome-wide Association Studies in Diverse Ancestral Populations Reveal Genes Implicated in an Anxiety-Related Phenotype_ by Maya Z. Sharma and Heather E. Wheeler. 

**Sumstat_Prep**
Includes scripts for harmonizing and lifting over Pan-UKB summary statistics from genome build 37 to build 38.

**Fine-Mapping**
Includes scripts used to generate input files for LocusZoom and produce Manhattan plots for fine-mapping analyses.

**TWAS**
Includes used to perform our TWAS using S-prediXcan, along with scripts to generate Manhattan plots of the resulting summary statistics.

**Colocalization**
Includes scripts for running colocalization analyses with `coloc`  and `coloc.susie`, as well as for generating LocusCompareR plots. Several scripts in this folder address formatting requirements specific to LocusCompareR (adding rsids to GWAS input). 

**FUMA**
Includes scripts for constructing our gene sets of interest and background gene sets for gene set enrichment analysis using FUMA.
